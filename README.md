As a devoted fan of Vincent van Gogh, I have created an imaginary e-commerce website that sells 77 of the artist's paintings. All of these paintings were painted in the last three months of his life, after he moved to the small town of Auvers-sur-Oise, just outside of Paris, up to the day he shot himself in the stomach in the summer of 1890.

Please launch the API by clicking the button below. You could search for a particular painting by name in the search bar on the left or filter the paintings by three categories: portraits, landscapes and still lives. Click the thumbnails to find out more about the paintings and order the prints in one of the four sizes available: original, half, quarter and postcard sizes. Go to the cart on the top right and you can see all the posters you have selected and the total price.

The website is built in React with Vite. At the moment, only the frontend part has been implemented. The backend side is to follow along with new features such as a login system as well as a map API that tells you the current locations of the paintings.
